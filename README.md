# Dice Roll Metrics

This is a C++ application developed using Qt to simulate dice rolls and track the statistical data of the outcomes. The application allows for rolling a die a specific number of times and displays the results and statistical information.

## Features

- Simulate dice rolls with options to roll 1, 100, 1,000, 100,000, 1,000,000, or 2,000,000 times.
- Display the image of the rolled die on the user interface.
- Update and display statistics, including the count and percentage of each dice face.
- Reset the simulation data and statistics.

## How to Build and Run

1. Install [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download) (if not already installed).
2. Open the project in Qt Creator.
3. Extract the dice images:
   - Locate the `Dice_images.zip` file in the project directory.
   - Extract the contents of the ZIP file directly into the project directory. This will create a `Dice_images` folder with the necessary image files.
4. Build and run the project within Qt Creator.

## Resources

- Dice images are included in the `Dice_images.zip` file. Ensure to extract these images into the project directory.

## Note

- Comments in the code are provided in English for clarity and consistency.
